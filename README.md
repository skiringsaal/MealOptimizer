# MealOptimizer

This is a small library of python functions to help you figure out how much of each food you can consume in order to meet your calorie and macro goals. You provide your calorie goal, you provide the foods you want to eat, you provide your target protein : carbohydrate : fat percentages, and use these functions to know the amount of each food.

Please use at your own risk, this software does not give professional dietary recommendations. I've built this library based on information I could find freely on the internet.

To get started, use the "meal_optimizer_sample_usage.py". This is a script that shows how to use each function in the library.

You will need
  - Python3
  - Numpy

To run the usage script, download the files to a location and navigate into it, then

```sh
$ python3 meal_optimizer_sample_usage.py
```
